# ETL Project: Wine Review Data
Vipul Aggarwal, Liliana Joya, Kannika Phadougxath

## Project Scope

The scope of this project is to perform ETL on a dataset regarding wine reviews and complementary information obtained from different sources. The wine data is extracted from Kaggle, Wikipedia and the Geopy library, then cleaned, transformed, and normalized to a form where it is ready to be loaded into a database, in this case, via SQLAlchemy.
