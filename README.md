# ETL Project: Wine Review Data
Collaborators: Vipul Aggarwal, Liliana Joya, Kannika Phadoungxath

## Project Scope

The scope of this project is to perform ETL on a dataset regarding wine reviews and complementary information obtained from different sources. The wine data is extracted from Kaggle, Wikipedia and the Geopy library, then cleaned, transformed, and normalized to a format where that is ready to be loaded into a relational database(PosgreSQL) via SQLAlchemy.

For a full report on our ETL project, please refer to the ETL Project Final Technical Report Word document. 

### Data Cleanup & Analysis
Once you we have identified our datasets, we will perform ETL on the data. We've outlined the following in our technical report:
1. The sources of data that we will extract from - [Wine Review Data](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews).
2. The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
3. The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
4. The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.
